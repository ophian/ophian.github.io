This blog is about the Serendipity Styx Edition.

[Styx](https://github.com/ophian/styx) is what Serendipity should be!

### Serendipity Styx - A reliable, secure &amp; extensible PHP blog engine

[Serendipity](https://s9y.org) is a PHP-powered weblog engine which gives the user an easy way to maintain a blog. While the default package is designed for the casual blogger, Serendipity offers an expandable framework with the power for professional applications.

### Why Styx?

Its project name originally originates from _"River Styx"_ in the Greek classical mythology.

If this is too dark for you, you may read this as **S**erendipi**ty** Ne**x**t. :) or just **Sty x**.  
_Serendipity 2.1-Alpha ++_ more and more became a broken playground, simplifying things without need and commits without knowledge and appreciation about its deepest nuances. Which I regret deeply.

**Styx** is what **Serendipity** should be!

Over many many years I very actively helped to develop Serendipity, in special the 1.7, 2.0 and 2.1 Series, the plugins section, and daily guided community requests in the forum. Realising some day that my expertise and insight wasn't seen that helpful any more, I decided to go.

### The Serendipity Styx Edition

It was built in my origin intent primarily for myself to keep track on my vision of what Serendipity used to be, wide and open, and with multi levels of extended properties. I wanted it - to **not** cut off this extendibility without real need. Styx is a contributed document of my deep affinity with Serendipity.

As long as I find the time and the commitment to make this even better, Styx will develop and will include all good parts of the origin Serendipity development. You may replace your origin Serendipity installation without any fear with this extended Edition and you will find everything work as intendet. Go and read the **Styx** [Wiki](https://github.com/ophian/styx/wiki) to see how this can be easily done without too much effort. Even more you may want to read the [commit history](https://github.com/ophian/styx/commits/master) and/or the **Styx** [ChangeLog](https://github.com/ophian/styx/blob/master/docs/NEWS).

Since **plugins** are an essential part of Serendipity, this repository holds a strongly maintained [additional_plugins](https://github.com/ophian/additional_plugins) repository. The Styx Spartacus plugin is able to work with it - Serendipity is not.

The origin Serendipity help documentation is found on the Serendipity website at s9y.org, and you are requested to read all about it there, as long as it suites Styx too in the main parts. Some important changes between the two editions will have to be added to the Styx Wiki or this page sooner or later, I assume.
