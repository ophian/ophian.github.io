### 4.2.0 - A Maintenance Release

Serendipity Styx 4.2 revision will probably be the last middle update Series supporting the PHP 7.4 Series.
The previously announced change to PHP 8 minimum requirement was stashed and we now start developing Serendipity Styx 5.0 up from PHP 8.2 as the minimum.
Styx 4.2 has ironed out several bugs and other inconsistencies and is pretty much another good maintenance release, pushing a new ðŸ˜Ž Styx Logo. Read the ChangeLog.

## Styx 4.2.0 faces

  - Add the new Styx Logo. "Gone fishing... Phishing for inspiration..."
