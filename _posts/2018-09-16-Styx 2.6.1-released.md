Styx 2018/5 - Short bugfix update for certain issues

<div markdown="1">
 <div>

<h2>Refactor, Rebuild, Regression</h2><br>

<p>Mainly an odd plain editor NL2BR / NL2P parsing regression added by Styx 2.6-alpha1 was fixed, that prevented correct parsing of plain text markup_elements.</p>

<p>Also the maintenance MediaLibrary-Synchronize thumbnail rebuilding area was refactored and conditionally fixed. It now works very much as expected.</p>

<p><strong>Serendipity Styx</strong> Edition is up to date!</p>
