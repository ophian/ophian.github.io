title: The new Styx website - finally
---

This January I started my new years 2018 Styx revision of the Serendipity Book, which finally needed a handy place and mockup to be presented to the readers.

### For this I created this NEW

<div markdown=1>

  * **Serendipity Styx Edition** [Home](https://ophian.github.io/) website, to document what needed to be documented for Serendipity and Serendipity Styx.
  * There is no need to hop over to S9y origin any more. Everything is in place and hopefully well organized.
  * The revised documents have been placed into the Styx [en] [help center](https://ophian.github.io/hc/en/) pages.
  * The german [Styx Book](https://ophian.github.io/book) is outside of this but bound into the same site environment.
  * Even **Spartacus** found a sparkling new home and you will now be able to see Styx [Plugins](https://ophian.github.io/plugins/) and origin Serendipity [Themes](https://ophian.github.io/themes/) here.
  * ...
  * Since 2.4 the Styx development has slowed down a bit, but I am sure 2018 will see some outstanding releases again.

</div>

**Enjoy Styx !**

PS. Please give me a note if you found something to tweak or make even better. Thanks.
