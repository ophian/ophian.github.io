title: The new Styx website - finally
---

This January I started my new years 2018 Styx revision of the Serendipity Book, which finally needed a handy place and mockup to be presented to the readers.

For this I created this shiny **new**...

<div markdown="1">

  - **Serendipity Styx Edition** [Home](https://ophian.github.io/) website, to document what needed to be documented for Serendipity and Serendipity Styx.
  - There is no need to hop-over to S9y origin any more. Everything is in place and hopefully well organized.
  - The revised documents have been placed into the Styx [en] [help center](https://ophian.github.io/hc/en/) pages.
  - The german [Styx Book](https://ophian.github.io/book) is outside of this but bound into the same site environment.
  - Even **Spartacus** found a sparkling new home and you will now be able to enjoy outstanding and well cared Styx [Plugins](https://ophian.github.io/plugins/) and origin Serendipity additional [Themes](https://ophian.github.io/themes/) here.
  - …
  - Since the last 2.4 release, the Styx development has slowed down a bit, but I am sure that 2018 will see some outstanding releases again.

**Enjoy Styx !**

PS. Please give me a note if you found something to tweak or make even better. Thanks.
