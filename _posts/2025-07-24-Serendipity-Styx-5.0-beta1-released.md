### 5.0-beta1 - A Beta-Test release of new Serendipity Styx 5.0

After a long run the development of upcoming Styx 5.0 came to a public state and is waiting for your tests, my fellow bloggers !
THANK YOU for helping us to finish and finalize this new Serendipity Styx 5.0 major version ! Read the ChangeLog, please.

## Styx 5.0

  - Refactored the language system
  - Refactored the RichText Editor from CKEditor to TinyMCE
  - Use of strict types for the API
  - Multiple fixes and improvement
  - Modernize structures for modernized Browsers
  - Cache improvements
  - and so much more (...to be completed)

It is expected that we will get some exception errors with non-yet converted plugins that are not so much mainstream. If you run into these please file an (core)[https://github.com/ophian/styx/issues] or (plugin)[https://github.com/ophian/additional_plugins/issues] at GitHub or mention them in the discussions. Just paste the error exception with the stack trace and explain what you did to get there, so it is easy to reproduce. Normally you can just resume with your work afterwards by going back in your browsers history or by returning to the start page of your Backend or Frontend.
See you on next ðŸ˜Ž Serendipity Styx 5.0 revisions !ðŸ˜ƒ
