Styx 2019/4 - The Serendipity Styx 2.9 branch 2.9.1 release.

Since heavy development of upcoming Serendipity Styx 3.0 is making huge progress, several issues were found in the 2.9.0 branch too. This is a point BugFix release.

Serendipity Styx is PHP 7.3 READY and requires PHP from 5.5+!
This 2.9 branch is the LAST edition supporting the old PHP 5 Series and will only get security or important bugfixes as point releases.
Serendipity Styx NEXT will be 3.0, which will require a modern PHP 7.x version.

## Styx 2.9.1 runs (...some highlights)

  - Bugfix some non violent extended features of Serendipity
  - Fix some Themes extending features
  - Fixed the stable Archive
  - Some language constant fixes and improvements
