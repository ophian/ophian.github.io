N° 2023/1 - **20 years** of Serendipity

<div markdown="1">

<h2>🎂 Still living… and <em>better than ever</em> ❗</h2><br>

<p>Its time to give an update of development and the future plans for <strong>Serendipity</strong>.</p>

<p>Upcoming Serendipity Styx 4.1 revision will be the last update supporting the PHP 7.4 Series, while next 4.2 will require PHP 8. Needless to say, recommended to use is the latest PHP 8.2 revision which allows to use all features Serendipity Styx already supports. Styx 4.1 has ironed out some bugs and other inconsistencies and is pretty much a maintenance release, but also improves the handling with some new configuration options,&nbsp; MediaLibrary selection fields and better language descriptions.</p>

<p>Serendipity Styx will have to check for a new Rich Text Editor (WYSIWYG), since the current CKEditor 4 Series has an end-of-life scheduled for 2023. The excellent new CKE 5 Series is something totally different and would require a total rebuild and split for current textarea usage on Serendipity side, which seems to be a <em>no go</em>. Other "CMS" out there do face the same issue and probably the most are going to change to TinyMCE.</p>

<p>Further plans for <strong>Serendipity Styx</strong> will see a refactoring of the current language system to <strong>UTF-8</strong> only and maybe even move away from current constant only usage. <em>Time will tell.</em></p>

<p>Now, lets have a deep look in the miraculous mirror of futures…</p>

<p><em>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br />
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
And the mome raths outgrabe …</em><br />
