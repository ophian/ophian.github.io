N° 2023/1 - **20 years** of Serendipity

<div markdown="1">
 <div>

<h2>You’ve come a very long way, and still living... <em>better than ever</em> ! What a fortunate stroke of <em>serendipity</em> !</h2><br>

<p>Its time to give an update of development and the future plans for <strong>Serendipity</strong>. Upcoming Serendipity Styx 4.1 revision will be the last update supporting the PHP 7.4 Series while next 4.2 will require PHP 8. Recommended to use is the latest PHP 8.2 version which allows all features Serendipity Styx already supports.</p>

<p>Serendipity Styx probably will have to check for a new Rich Text Editor (WYSIWYG) soon, since the current CKEditor 4 Series has an end-of-life scheduled for 2023. The new CKE 5 Series is something totally different and would at least require a totally rebuild for current textarea usage. Other "CMS" out there do face the same issue and probably the most are going to change to TinyMCE.</p>

<p>Further plans for <strong>Serendipity Styx</strong> will need a refactoring of the current language system to <strong>UTF-8</strong> only and maybe even move away from current constant only usage. Time will tell.</p>

<p>Now, lets have a deep look in the miraculous mirror of futures... </p>

<p><em>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
And the mome raths outgrabe ...<br><br>Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll.</em></p>
