### 4.0.0 - New Mayor Version

Finally the new mayor 4.0.0 release has rounded. Thanks for any help with our last public pre releases.

So today - with the new public release of shiny new PHP 8.2 - we shift this fully compatible Serendipity version.

## Styx 4.0.0 finalizes with

  - Improved plugin html nugget areas for markupeditor/type assignments
  - Some resolved fixes and found oddities related to configurations or plugins
  - Improved the [ pure ] theme comments area in special for the dark theme mode and the used font
  - Upgrade some template and core assets
