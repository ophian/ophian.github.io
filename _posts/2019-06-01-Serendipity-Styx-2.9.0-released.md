NÂ° 2019/3 - The Serendipity Styx 2.9.0 release - 50 years Montreal "Bed-In" **"Give Peace a Chance" (1969)** Edition.

Since the more template focused Styx 2.8.0 version was somehow delayed in early April 2019 and then was overrun by a real flood of Core improvements and fixes, this version was abandoned in favor of 2.9.0.

Serendipity Styx is PHP 7.3 READY and requires PHP from 5.5+!
This is the LAST edition supporting the old PHP 5 Series and will only get security or important bugfixes as point releases.
Serendipity Styx NEXT will be 3.0, which will require a modern PHP 7.x version.

## Styx 2.9.0 runs (...some highlights)

  - Various THEMES were improved to give a better migration to HTML5. Read on in the ChangeLog and keep your copy themes up-to-date!
  - Various old and some newer bugs were fixed
  - Improved media renaming and for all db types
  - Improved various group permission related access privileges
  - Important Security fixes
  - Improved error reporting for all DB layers
  - Improved backend comments list counter by permissions
  - Upgrade jQuery lib
  - UTF8 mb4 support ready for all DB types
  - Trackback improvements
  - NL2BR plugin nl2p-mode improvements
  - Timeline theme update
  - Improved setCookie
  - Improved access for auto-update method
  - Various language constant fixes and improvements

It is again a GOOD IDEA to take the advantage of starting a new copy template, before adapting each single theme change to your old copy themes!
