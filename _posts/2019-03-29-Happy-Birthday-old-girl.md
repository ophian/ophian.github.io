N° 2019/1 - **16 years** of Serendipity

<div markdown="1">
 <div>

<h2>You’ve come a long way, ... what a fortunate stroke of <em>serendipity</em> !</h2><br>

<p>Its time to give an update of development and the future plans for <strong>Serendipity</strong>. Upcoming Serendipity Styx 2.8 revision will be the last update for the old and outdated PHP 5 Series and future 2.8.x dot versions will only address security or real bug fixes.</p>

<p>Serendipity Styx 2.8.0 will prepare the core system themes for consistency and to easily live in these modern “mobile-device” times without breaking too much for fallback or engine depend themes.</p>

<p>Then <strong>Serendipity Styx</strong> will strongly jump right to 3.0 and will further only support PHP 7 Editions. And it will be (much more) “feature” complete. 🙂</p>

<p><em>I sat for years and found you saying:<br>Never mind old chap, I will resist<br>kill my bugs, that still persist!</em></p>
