### 4.0-rc1 - Public Release Candidate 1

Thanks for the help with our last Beta2. More ðŸ˜Ž improvements were made!
Please help for making this upcoming 4.0 release a very smooth release.

## Styx 4.0-rc1 contains

  - Finished the comments escape refactoring. From now on a mix of switched markup editors should not matter anymore for elder blogs.
  - NEW: Deny mixing of PLAIN TEXT editor default buttons in the entry forms when used with markup editors like markdown or textile plugins. A workaround variable for the old behaviour is supported. Read the news (changelog) file. This new (more strict) behaviour clarifies what you actually have and (want to) use.
  - This and that to both relations for consistencies and other minor improvements.
