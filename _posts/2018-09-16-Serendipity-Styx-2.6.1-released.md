NÂ° 2018/5 - Short bugfix update for certain issues

<div markdown="1">

<h2>Refactor, Rebuild, Regression</h2><br>

<p>Mainly an odd plain editor NL2BR / NL2P parsing regression was fixed, that prevented correct parsing of plain text markup_elements in certain situations.</p>

<p>Also the maintenance MediaLibrary-Synchronizer thumbnail rebuilding area was refactored and conditionally fixed. It now works very much as expected.</p>

<p><strong>Serendipity Styx</strong> Edition is up to date!</p>
