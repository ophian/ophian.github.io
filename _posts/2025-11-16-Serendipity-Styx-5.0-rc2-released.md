N° 2025/04 - The new Serendipity Styx 5.0-rc2 of new major release <img class="php8" src="/i/b/logo_php8_4.svg" alt="php8.4" width="160" height="48">

Requirements: At least PHP 8.2 !!

Better use PHP 8.4 !! And it looks like we are already prepared for upcoming PHP 8.5 😀 !! Latest PHP 8.5 RC builds run fine.

### 5.0-rc2 - A Release-Test-Candidate of new Serendipity Styx 5.0 heading to final release

THANK YOU for helping us to finish and finalize this new Serendipity Styx 5.0 major version ! Read the ChangeLog, please.

## Styx 5.0-rc2

  - Fix some more comment handling type issues
  - Fix libraries for type issues and PHP 8.5 deprecations
  - The RichText Editor auto focus behavior was refactored to not auto focus itself since this brought too many problems in the frontend and as well in some backend places
  - Bug fixes
  - Fixed several PHP 8.5 deprecation issues
  - Improved styles (read the changelog if using copy or child themes, please)
  - and more ...

It is expected that we will get some exception errors with non-deeply checked plugins that are not so much mainstream. If you run into these please file a [core issue](https://github.com/ophian/styx/issues) or [plugin issue](https://github.com/ophian/additional_plugins/issues) over at GitHub or mention them in the [discussions](https://github.com/ophian/styx/discussions). Just paste the error exception with the stack trace and explain what you did to get there, so it is easy to reproduce. Normally you can just resume with your work afterwards by going back in your browsers history or by returning to the start page of your Backend or Frontend.

Thanks again; See you soon on next 😎 Serendipity Styx 5.0 revisions !😃
