---

The Styx October 2.4-beta1 release brings exiting news for MySQLi users, "finally" fixes the MediaLibrary and adds a new maintenance cleanup widget. And much more. Check the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/ophian/styx/blob/2.4-beta1/docs/NEWS) for details!
And remember, Styx is **PHP 7.1.x** ready!

## Styx 2.4-beta1 runs (...some highlights)

  - Set minimum required PHP version to 5.4+
  - Adding the migration task for full utf8mb4 unicode support on MySQL server databases >= v.5.5.3
  - Installing new systems already utf8mb4 ready, if supported
  - Adding a new spambloglog cleanup widget for SPAM-blown-up log database tables
  - Adding responsiveimages event plugin, which creates an easy way for authors to upload differently sized images and to scale images to the visitors viewport width
  - Fixing some more old and odd bugs in the MediaLibrary and its tasks (see changelog for details)
  - Preparations for translatable theme info strings for the themes info.txt file info layer, already done for [de]
  - Lots of optimising for the lang constants
  - Other optimized (backend) handlers and bugfixes
  - And some more...
