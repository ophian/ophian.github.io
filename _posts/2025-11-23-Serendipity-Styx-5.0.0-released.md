### 5.0.0 - The final release of new Serendipity Styx 5.0.0 ++

THANK YOU for support and help ! Read the ChangeLog, please.

## Styx 5.0.0 since RC2

  - Fix some more comment handling issues
  - Improve some variable checks
  - Fixed a postgreSQL type issue
  - Improved [ pure ] theme styles
  - Ready for brand new PHP 8.5
  - and more ...

## Styx 5.0.1 and 5.0.2

  - Fixed some issues with new plugins syncs and null values which only occurred on live systems causing fatal error halts


For the real major NEWS updates regarding Styx 5.0, please read below release candidate and beta Announcements.

It is expected that we will get some exception errors with non-deeply checked plugins that are not so much mainstream. If you run into these please file a [core issue](https://github.com/ophian/styx/issues) or [plugin issue](https://github.com/ophian/additional_plugins/issues) over at GitHub or mention them in the [discussions](https://github.com/ophian/styx/discussions). Just paste the error exception with the stack trace and explain what you did to get there, so it is easy to reproduce. Normally you can just resume with your work afterwards by going back in your browsers history or by returning to the start page of your Backend or Frontend.

Thanks again; See you soon on next 😎 Serendipity Styx 5.x revisions !😃

*One last word:* If there isn't a necessary .3 bugfix release required, the next version will be Styx 5.1.0, which will finally clean up old UTF-8 language file directories. Please update your local or development plugins and themes until then! This is announced in the upgrade tasks to 5.0.0.
