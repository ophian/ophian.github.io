### 4.5.0 - Pre Winter Edition and maintenance release

Since Styx 4.4.2 release the development of Styx 5 started and on its way some relevant issues and improvements were found to now file a new Styx 4 revision.

In some weeks we will also see the release of the new PHP 8.4 version. Styx 4.5 is ready for it and you better update your system to current Styx 4.5 before getting on this train. The new PHP 8.4 ready logo will find its way to this blog post when it is officially announced at php.net. Please update to the latest available PHP version for your system, to be able to work with all features Serendipity Styx supports.
